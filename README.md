# ADIDAS US SALES - POWERBI DASHBOARD
We developed a PowerBI dashboard for the dataset Adidas US Sales, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset).

The repository contains the following files:
- PowerBI dashboard
- Jupyter notebook for the data cleaning and data enrichment procedures
- Jupyter notebook for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline ([click here for Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uaSzoGZPcrC88j7IVILwBDNghTBH1KXr?usp=sharing))
- Custom version of the original dataset, without the logo banners, input for the cleaning notebook
- Cleaned version of the dataset, output of the the cleaning notebook and input for the PowerBI dashboard

The analysis was carried out for academic purpose.
